Book review
Dava Sobel's best-seller. Longitude, tells the story of John Harrison's long [battle] with the English establishment of the 18th century to prove that his clocks were the best way to measure longitude at sea. The establishment [impersonated] in the figure of Sir Nevile Maskelyne found it demeaning that a simple, uneducated mechanic could do better than all the brilliant astronomers. Maskelyne did everything he could to frustrate Harrison. Reading this book, I was struck by how many great inventors have had little education, and in particular how little they [owe] to science. Harrison [found out] mechanics while working as an apprentice carpenter. Thomas Edison had less than three months of normal schooling and Guillermo Marconi had a limited formal education. With the exception of James Watt, none of the great pioneers of steam was even literate, [let] alone university educated.	9.

Deserts 1
Deserts exist in every continent of the world apart from Europe. Most deserts are hot, but there are also cold deserts. In fact, the world's largest desert is Antarctica, [which] is made almost completely of ice. The Sahara desert [covers] ten per cent of Africa, and is the world's largest hot desert. However, the hottest place on earth is Death Valley in California; on 10 July 1913, the temperature there [reached] 56.7 °C – the highest temperature [ever] recorded.Some plants manage to live in deserts, but they grow very slowly. The saguaro cactus, for example, [takes] thirty years to grow one metre tall.	11.	
Deserts 2
Deserts exist in every continent of the world apart from Europe. A region can be called a desert if its
[average] annual rainfall is under 250 mm. [While] most deserts are hot, there are also cold deserts, such as Antarctica, a desert made almost completely of ice.
Deserts are often [thought] of as impossible places to live in, but they are actually home to a [wide] range of plants and animals. With so [little] rainfall, plants grow slowly and only flower on rare occasions.	12.

Getting on Well at Work
Most people spend so much of their lives at work that it's [vital] to develop good relationships with those around them.
Humour is always a help. If you can laugh at yourself and with your colleagues, you'll be more than [halfway] there. Don't be upset by teasing; touchy people always get more than their [fair] share of people making fun of them because they are seen to be vulnerable. It's a hard world, and you have to be quite tough to [withstand] the pressures.
The best practical advice is to try hard to keep on top of the job. If you feel comfortable about this, you'll be less anxious and have more energy left to [devote] the crucial task of relating to others.	16.

John Ruskin 1
In the nineteenth century, John Ruskin, an English writer and art critic, made great efforts to encourage people to draw, believing that this was a much-neglected skill. As well as giving lectures, he published two books on drawing, which were [widely] read. Ruskin's efforts were not I [aimed] at turning people into good artists but at making them happier. He felt that, when we are involved in the process of drawing something, we become more aware of the different parts which [make] up the whole. 
It is in this way that we [come] to a deeper appreciation and [understanding] of the thing itself.	17.

Oldest big cat fossil found in Tibet
Scientists have identified a new big cat fossil. Found in the foothills of the Himalayas, the fragments are considered to be the oldest ones ever unearthed and have been dated [between] 4.1 and 5.95 million years old. Their discovery in Tibet supports the theory [that] asserts big cats evolved in central Asia-not Africa- and spread.
“this is a very significant finding as it gives us a great insight into [what] early big cats may have looked like and where they may have lived”, reported Dr Tseng who led the 2010 expedition. Scientists used both anatomical and DNA data [to] determine that the sculls belonged to an extinct big cat, whose territory appears to overlap many of the species we know today.
The DNA evidence suggests they diverged [from] their cousins the Felinae-which includes cougars, lynxes and domestic cats- about 6/37 million years ago.	21.

The ancient Roman City of Ostia
The Roman city of Ostia took its name from the Latin ostium, meaning river mouth. According to texts from writer and poet Ennius, from historian Titus Levy, from the writer Cicero - to mention but a [few] scholars of Roman civilization - Ostia was founded around eight thousand years ago by Ancus Martius, the fourth king of Rome. The king was desperate to assure an outlet for the military and commercial expansion of Rome, [which] at that time was still relatively small. After conquering the coastal populations standing in the way of this project, Ancus Martius [had] a citadel built near the mouth of the river. His soldiers were thus ideally located when it [came] to controlling navigation on the river Tiber. It is known that the design of the citadel [must] have been modified later, since the ruins of Ostia today contain hardly any original structures.	25.

The hot river
Deep in the Amazon jungle there's an amazing natural phenomenon: a river so hot italmost boils. How on [Earth]   is that possible? It's all down to a series of hotsprings that heat up water flowing into the river. It's the only river [of] its kind  anywhere in the world. Of course, hot springs are not unique to this area – they [can] be found all over the world. They normally occur where there arevolcanoes, yet there are none anywhere near this river.
Locals have, on occasion, [been] known to swim in the river, but only after heavy rain has reduced the temperature considerably. More often than [that], theriver is used simply for making tea and cooking.	28.	
The River Amazon
Although the River Amazon is not as long as the River Nile, it carries much more water. Starting high in the Andes mountains of Peru, the river [passes] through the rainforest of Brazil. On its long journey towards the Atlantic Ocean, it increases in size as it [is] fed by thousands of smaller rivers such as the River Negro, which [joins] the Amazon near the city of Manaus.
By the time the Amazon [gets/reaches?] the sea, it is very wide. Every second, it pours 200.000 cubic metres of water into the ocean. This is the same [amount] of water that is held by a hundred Olympic-sized swimming pools.	29.

Universal Wet Weekend
The weather across much of the British Isles remained settled last week, with a good deal of sunshine. The rest of the world, however, was coping with some [extreme] conditions. Hong Kong had 333 mm of rainfall over the weekend, not far off the [average] for the entire month of August. The southern Chinese town of Shanwei was [soaking] up the 468 mm of rain which fell in sixty hours up to midday on Sunday, [nearly] twice the usual August rainfall. Although most of Europe enjoyed sun, the high temperatures were sufficient to set off some [heavy] showers. On Tuesday morning a thunderstorm at Lyon in eastern France deposited 99 mm of rain in just six hours.	30.

Amelia Earhart, Pioneer Woman Pilot (1897- 1927)
Amelia Earhart, the pioneering woman pilot, had [her] first flying lesson in January 1921, and convinced herself that she was destined to become a pilot. In the six months that followed, she managed to save enough money to buy a plane. Earhart named the bright yellow plane “The Canary”,and put it to good use, setting the first women's record by rising [to] an altitude of 14,000 feet,a remarkable achievement.

Juggling
Juggling involves throwing a number of objects up into the air and catching them again. Probably the greatest juggler was Enrico Rastelli, who was born in Siberia in 1896.
Although Rastelli spent some of his early years in Italy, it [was] in Russia that he acquired hisjuggling skills. He was able to juggle [as] many as eight balls at the same time. However, [what] made him a genius was his perfect style, rather [than] the number of objects he couldjuggle. One of his specialties was throwing a ball into the air, and then catching [it] on a stickheld in his mouth, a practice later copied by other jugglers.	20.
